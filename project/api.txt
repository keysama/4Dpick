Return Status Flow

Payout Submission Process

The Gateway uses standard html web form submission via HTTP Post to establish the Payout Transfer from server.
??

Due to security reason, we will only allow whitelisted IP to communicate with us.

It will return HTTP 403 Forbidden error while it is not whitelisted.
??

The table listing below shown the parameters for payout submission.





Mechant will call the gateway＊s payout transaction service and the gateway will response respectively message to merchant.

XML format sample:

<Payout>

<statusCode>000</statusCode>

<message>Success</message>

</Payout>


Note:





Create Hash Key for Payout Submission

To prevent unauthorized or fraudulent Payout Submission. The Gateway requires the Merchant to generate a Key for Payout Submission with SecurityCode.

1ㄘ Transaction is received by the Gateway, hash Key will be verified. The payment process will stop immediately if the verification fails. (a)

2ㄘ During Payout Submission process, gateway require Merchant provide a page to allow Gateway to post http request to cross check/confirm the transaction submit by merchant. (a)(b)

(a)

To generate the hash Key, Merchant is required to use cryptographic hash function, MD5 to hash the combination of details (Merchant, Reference, Customer, Amount, Currency, and Datetime) during Payment Submission with SecurityCode. Details as shown below:

MD5({MerchantCode }{TransactionId }{MemberCode }{Amount}{CurrencyCode}{TransactionDat etime}{ToBankAccountNumber }{SecurityCode})

Below is the sample of generating Key.

MerchantCode = ※M00001§

TransactionID = ※T123456789§

MemberCode = ※CUST1001§

Amount = ※12.00§

CurrencyCode = ※CNY§

TransactionDatetime = ※2012-05-21 08:04:00PM§

ToBankAccountNumber = ※12345678§

SecurityCode = ※eQIkGnUeK§



String to be hash will be MD5

(※M00001T123456789CUST100112.00CNY2012052120040012345678eQIkGnUeK§)

Notes:

1.	TransactionDate must be in ※yyyyMMddHHmmss§ format, and the hour in 24 hours＊ time format. e.g.

2012-01-15 2:12PM will be 20120115141200,

2012-12-17 2:12AM will be 20121217021200

2.	Amount displayed will be in 2 decimal point format. e.g.

1200 will be 1200.00

523.1 will be 523.10



(b)Withdrawal verification URL

Withdrawal verification URL will use to confirm the payout request is from your system. To work correctly, our system will make a http request to the provided URL with transaction data and the URL ONLY should print/display a word ※True§ on the page. Else it will trigger fail status request with the error ※failed to verify with merchant response§.

Thus, you will need to provide us an API to callback.

Sample POST URL: www.ImMerchant01.com/verifytransaction.aspx?transId=1&key=abc123

Query String explanation:

transId : the transaction id from merchant01

key : is the hash key from H2P for merchant01 to verify(refer (a))

Result:

A result response from merchant. (Not case sensitive)





Response handling for Payout Result


After the Payment Submission process, the gateway calls back the Merchant＊s backend URL (BackURI provided during merchant＊s Payment Submission) with corresponding Payment Result.

The table listing below show details of the variables returned in the result.





Status Result Return


During the Payout process, every single Payout result will be returned to Merchant upon completion. Similarly, the Key is also used for the Payout Result for verifying the response from the Gateway to the Merchant.

The Payout Result will only be considered as valid when the generated encryption hash matches with Key.

To generate the Key hash, Merchant is required to use cryptographic hash function, MD5 to hash the combination of details (Merchant, Reference, Amount and Currency) by using the SecurityCode.

Details as shown below:

{Key} =

MD5({MerchantCode}{TransactionID}{MemberCode}{Amount}{CurrencyCode}{Status}{SecurityC

ode})

Below is the sample of generating the Encryption Key.

MerchantCode = ※M00001§

TransactionID = ※T123456789§

MemberCode = ※CUST1001§

Amount = ※12.00§

CurrencyCode = ※CNY§

StatusCode = §000§

SecurityCode = ※eQIkGnUeK§



String to be hash will be MD5(※M00001T123456789CUST100112.00CNY000eQIkGnUeK§) Notes:

1.	Amount display will be in 2 decimal point format. e.g.

1200 will be 1200.00

523.1 will be 523.10

2.	Be reminded that the matching of the generated encryption hash and Key is not case sensitive.
